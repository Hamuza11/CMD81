TO DO:
1. Move to Pimoroni SD driver - by default should have right pins, use stand alone test? DONE
2. Parse ini file to set joystick. Write test program to parse ini file for 332, then maker, then vga using Pimoroni SD driver DONE - maker TO DO
3. Integrate into picozx81 DONE
4. check in pico ZX81 - remove sound at that point DONE
5. Take pictures DONE
6. Try to move to vga demo - disable UART DONE
7. Move to Maker TO DO
8. Try out sound (e.g. for C64) DONE
9. Make 222 ladder
10. Wire second VGA cable
11. Test audio and vga 222 on maker
12. Start to develop drivers for real keyboard and joystick on ZXPICO
13. Investigate port of sz81 common DONE - 12 times too slow :-(
14. Use DMA rather than 31.25kHz interrupt 32k interrupt better than DMA, as vgaboard has audio over two slices DONE
15. Time remaining CPU when running QS Defenda with sound over 15% at 200MHz - DONE ok
16. Look at high res issues in Celebration - Hack / workaround to avoid losing tstates each line - DONE
17. Dual mono for 2 speakers - DONE - ACB stereo also done
18. Write read me DONE
19. Port sz81 sound DONE
20. Build menu system DONE
21. Make FatFS a sub-module Not DONE as there is no definitive github store
22. Better solution for extern C DONE
23. QS UDG DONE
24. Configure WRX SRAM and UDG explicitly. DONE
    LowRAM defines RAM in 8k to 16K.
    WRX Means RAM can be used for graphics - always true if 2k or less RAM
    UDG Enables QS character board. Memory then limited to max of 16kB as board mapped at 0x8400. Enable UDG automatically, if selected, after first
    write to 0x8400 - 0x87FF
25. Limit memory to range 1k to 48K DONE
26. Display keyboard image DONE
    Glitch found and fixed through triple buffer (was not keyboard related) DONE
27. Add NTSC example directory with maxtext, QS Defenda, Spiro, Nova2005 DONE
28. Check hrdemo3 with NTSC DONE
29. Raise bug report against 2.3.12 in Github
30. Investigate WRX1K1 not working in 1K DONE - BASIC prog will not fit in 1K. It will run in "1K" on the latest EightyOne,
    but that is because "1K" is actually 2K - Peek 16389 gives 72
31. Implement I2S on vgaboard DONE
