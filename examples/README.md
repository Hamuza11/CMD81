# Config Files
This directory and the child directories contain the `config.ini` files used to test the program files described in the main [Readme](../README.md). The `config.ini` file in this directory should be placed in the root directory of the SD Card

Only one `.p` file is included. This is `eel.p` which was originally written by me in 1983. The other files can be downloaded by following the links in the main [Readme](../README.md)
