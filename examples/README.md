# Config Files
This directory and the child directories contain the `config.ini` files used to test the program files described in the main [Readme](../README.md). The `config.ini` file in this directory should be placed in the root directory of the SD Card

A set of files are included.
Each directory contains `simple.p` or `simple.o`. These are BASIC programs that print out how the emulator has been configured.

Two other `.p` files are included. One is `eel.p` which was originally written by me in 1983. The other is `flicker.p` which is a
trivial BASIC program to demonstrate the impact of PAUSE on vertical lock.

The `config.ini` files include configuration information for other programs. These programs can be downloaded by following the links in the main [Readme](../README.md)
